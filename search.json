    "text": "Our dataset: https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data This dataset contains a total of 3,669,928 observations with 225 different factors.The dataset is a valuable resource interested in understanding how maternal education, racial backgrounds, and maternal age impact various aspects of childbirth, healthcare, and demographic trends in the United States. It plays a critical role in addressing disparities and improving healthcare and support systems for expectant mothers and newborns\nData Cleaning: Can eliminate the following variables: Mother’s age, race, education, daily smoke before pregnancy, height in inches, bmi, weight in pound before pregnancy, weight in pound when delivered, gestational diabetes, Birth Weight\nOur focus: We are trying to use variables to make inference on the age at which a woman is pregnant. We also might combine data from both parents, variables determine the child’s health or even the child’s weight. We are trying to discover the variable and effect on women’s maternity situations.\nData for Equity Principle 1: Transparency For this principle, we will provide clear documentation on the process of how the data collected, cleaned, processed, and analyzed. To disclose transformations happening within the data and the rationale of what we based on. Principle 2: Privacy and Confidentiality Protect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals by ensuring that personally identifiable information is protected.Respecting individual privacy is essential for ethical data analysis and maintaining trust in the data collection process.\nLimitations We have a large dataset with 3,669,928 observations, This may cause overfitting. To fix this problem, we currently plan to build a model with samples with partial data. Secondly, there may exist selection bias on the variable. In the dataset, there are 225 different factors. We might be influenced by our perception of choosing/cleaning the dataset, which might bring in some bias. To overcome this problem, we would examine the variable carefully and minimize the chance of this type of bias.\nPotential for abuse or misuse The dataset contains comprehensive information of each recordent, there exists potential privacy breach. Besides, they might contain Bias in Treatment. As the dataset contains the information about the economic status and geographic region information, the revelations may give rise to biased behaviors."

    "text": "To explore and understand mother marnterl data, we try to combining datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.\nWe choose Real Per Capita Personal Income data—from 2016 to 2021. In our ongoing journey to explore and understand complex economic trends, we’ve embarked on an ambitious project: combining multiple datasets for a more comprehensive analysis. We delve into the integration of a Real Per Capita Personal Income data—from 2016 to 2021 dataset.\nThe process involves meticulously combining our original dataset with additional data, encompassing a range of CDC provided birth related variables from 2014 to 2021. These variables include the number of births, birth rate per 1,000 population, fertility rate per 1,000 women aged 15-44, percentages of births categorized as low birthweight and preterm, the percentage of unmarried mothers, and the mean age at first birth.\nWe’re still in the process of refining our analysis with new struture. There might need further data cleaning, exploring potential correlations, and following our past idea with our final project."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (Next week, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext week, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

Firstly, Our regression model(‘motheragemodel’) indicates a significant influence of mathernal age on birth outcomes. For every one-year increase in mathernal age, we observed a decreae in birth weight by about 4.85 grams.\nSecondly, our model also highlights the positive impact of mathernal education(‘meduc’). With each additional year of education, there’s an estimated 8.92 grams increase in birth weight, and the p value is less than alpha, which shows the importance of education in maternal and child health.\nLastly, Smoking habits before and during pregnancy (cig_before, cig_during) shows mothers who smoked before pregnancy had babies weighing 67.20 grams more than non-smokers. In addition, for mother who smoking during pregnancy, their babies weighing 259.91 grams less. This result shows extreme negative effects of continued smoking during pregnancy."

    "text": "Blog post 4 Our dataset: https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data\nAs always, make lots of plots and try different types of plots. However, for this week’s post, only include at most 2 figures/tables/output for your EDA and at most 1 figure/table/output for the modeling. Try to put together figures that illustrate the main lesson’s you’ve learned this week.\nMain Variables As mentioned previously, the main goal of our analysis is to observe the factors that influence a child’s weight at birth. Hence, our response variable comes naturally as “dbwt” or the birth weight in grams. We decided to observe the impact of numerous predictor variables on the birth weight, including:\n“mager”: Mother’s age of pregnancy “cig_before” (our variable): A variable we created that observes mothers who’ve smoked before pregnancy (“cig_0”), but not during(0 values for cig_1,cig_2, and cig_3) “cig_during” (our variable): A variable we created that observes mothers who’ve smoked during pregnancy (positive values in cig_1, cig_2, cig_3, cig_0) “cig_none” (our variable): A variable we created that observes whether or not the mother smoked at all “rf_gdiab”: Gestational diabetes “previs”: Number of prenatal visits “meduc”: Mother’s education in years “bmi”: Mother’s BMI\nColumn Transformations We have transformed the cig_0 (daily number of cigarettes before pregnancy), cig_1 (daily number of cigarettes during 1st trimester), cig_2 (daily number of cigarettes during 2nd trimester), and cig_3 (daily number of cigarettes during 3rd trimester) variables, to create two new dummy variables: “cig_before”, “cig_during”, and “cig_none”. These dummy variables would show whether or not smoking only before, during, or none at all affect the weight of the infant.\nLinear Modeling for First child birth age\nResidual standard error: 4.402 on 99990 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.412, Adjusted R-squared: 0.412 F-statistic: 7785 on 9 and 99990 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\nIn the linear regression analysis conducted, the dependent variable was the maternal age at first child’s birth (mager), modeled as a function of various maternal characteristics and health-related behaviors. The independent variables in the model included maternal education (meduc), height (m_ht_in), Body Mass Index (BMI), pre-pregnancy weight (pwgt_r), weight at delivery (dwgt_r), marital status (Married), presence of gestational diabetes (GDiabetes), and smoking habits before and during pregnancy (cig_before and cig_during, respectively). The results revealed that each of these factors had a statistically significant impact on the age at which a woman has her first child. Notably, maternal education emerged as a particularly influential factor, with the analysis indicating that each additional unit of education was associated with an increase of approximately 1.6 years in the age at first birth, controlling for other factors. This finding aligns with existing literature that suggests higher education levels often correlate with delayed childbearing. Other significant predictors included marital status and gestational diabetes, with married women and those with gestational diabetes having their first child at an older age. The model’s adjusted R-squared value was 0.412, indicating that approximately 41.2% of the variance in maternal age at first birth could be explained by the included predictors. This substantial proportion underscores the importance of these factors in understanding patterns of maternal age at first birth. The statistical significance of the model was confirmed with an F-statistic of 7785 on 9 and 99990 degrees of freedom, and a p-value of less than 2.2e-16, reinforcing the model’s robustness and the reliability of its predictions.\nModeling for Baby weight\nResidual standard error: 582.1 on 99989 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.04285, Adjusted R-squared: 0.04276 F-statistic: 447.7 on 10 and 99989 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\nIn this linear regression model, the dependent variable is the baby’s birth weight (dbwt), examined in relation to a set of maternal factors similar to those considered in the previous analysis. The independent variables encompass maternal age at first birth (mager), education level (meduc), height (m_ht_in), BMI, pre-pregnancy weight (pwgt_r), delivery weight (dwgt_r), marital status (Married), gestational diabetes (GDiabetes), and smoking habits before and during pregnancy (cig_before and cig_during). The model’s findings reveal that these factors are statistically significant predictors of birth weight, albeit with varying degrees of impact.Notably, maternal height and marital status were positively associated with higher birth weights, with each unit increase in height resulting in an 18.73-gram increase in birth weight. Conversely, smoking during pregnancy (cig_during) had a substantial negative impact, with each unit increase in this variable associated with a 387.74-gram decrease in birth weight, highlighting the significant adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy on fetal development. The effect of maternal age was negative, indicating a slight decrease in birth weight as maternal age increased.\nHowever, the overall explanatory power of this model, as indicated by the adjusted R-squared value (0.04276), suggests that only about 4.28% of the variability in birth weight is accounted for by these variables. This is significantly lower compared to the previous model predicting maternal age at first birth, where approximately 41.2% of the variance was explained. This difference might reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of factors influencing birth weight, many of which could be outside the scope of the variables considered in this model. The model’s statistical significance is affirmed by an F-statistic of 447.7 on 10 and 99989 degrees of freedom, with a p-value of less than 2.2e-16. Despite its statistical significance, the relatively low adjusted R-squared value underlines the necessity of considering additional or different factors to better understand and predict birth weight variations.\nDiagram of Birth Age vs Prepreg Education Level  The “First Kid Birth Age vs Prepreg Education Level” plot graphically delineates the correlation between maternal age at the birth of the first child and the education level prior to pregnancy, with race as a categorical variable. The depicted trends across all racial groups suggest a positive association between educational attainment and the age at which a woman has her first child. This consistency in trend indicates that higher education levels are potentially correlated with delayed childbearing, a phenomenon supported by demographic studies linking educational pursuits to later maternity. The variations in trend slopes across different races may imply underlying socio-economic and cultural factors influencing reproductive decisions. The confidence intervals, while providing a measure of estimate reliability, indicate less precision at the extremes of education levels, reflecting the inherent variability and potentially lower data density at these points.\nDiagram of Birthweight vs First Kid Birth Age  The plot visualizes the association between the birth weight of a child and the maternal age at the time of the first child’s birth, with race as a differentiating variable. The data suggests a non-linear relationship; for most racial groups, there is an initial increase in birth weight with maternal age, followed by a subsequent decline after a certain age threshold. The inference drawn from these trends could indicate a peak age range for optimal birth weight outcomes, which may vary by race. This peak likely reflects a complex interplay of biological and socio-economic factors, including health status and access to prenatal care. The width of the confidence intervals indicates varying degrees of certainty in the predictions, particularly at younger and older maternal ages, suggesting a need for cautious interpretation in these ranges. This pattern reiterates the significance of age as a factor in neonatal health."

    "text": "In the exploratory data analysis phase of our research, we meticulously selected a subset of 20,000 data points from each year spanning 2016 to 2021, from the extensive Vital Statistics Natality Birth Data. This strategic selection has allowed for a manageable yet representative dataset, enabling us to perform a more focused and detailed analysis. Our EDA process involves a multifaceted approach focused on the tendency of women first pregnant age and correlation, employing advanced statistical techniques to dissect and understand the nuances within the data. The aim here is to explore underlying trends, distributions, and potential relationships among key variables such as maternal age, education, race, and health conditions. By methodically visualizing and analyzing these yearly datasets, we aim to uncover evolving patterns and insights that could shed light on the factors influencing birth outcomes over these years.\nAfter careful consideration and preliminary analysis, our research has crystallized around a pivotal thesis focused on underage pregnancy. The thesis posits that “Underage pregnancy is intricately linked to a spectrum of socio-economic, educational, and health-related factors, and these relationships have evolved distinctly over the years from 2016 to 2021.” This thesis is not a mere hypothesis but a guiding statement that shapes our research direction. It implies defining how various factors influence underage pregnancy, with an emphasis on how the weight of different predictor variables have changed over recent years. The goal of our research is to delve into these aspects, using our rich dataset to substantiate or refine our thesis, thereby contributing meaningful insights into the discourse on underage pregnancy.\nIn the final stages of our research, significant emphasis is being placed on refining our visualizations and tables. Recognizing the crucial role of clear and compelling visuals in conveying complex data, we are employing tools like ggpubr for graph enhancements and the gt package for sophisticated table formatting. These tools not only aid in the aesthetic enhancement of our figures and tables but also ensure that we effectively communicate our findings and analysis. Each visualization is crafted to highlight key trends and insights, with special attention to detail in titles, captions, annotations, and highlights. This approach will help us reinforce and illustrate the primary findings and implications of our research, particularly in relation to our thesis on underage pregnancy. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfb8980d84d52a88d4476b23d16ed12658cb02e9f"

Its original purpose was to assess the risk of a heart attack, but it also includes variables related to other medical conditions, such as stress level, diabetes, obesity, and more. Using these variables, we can explore various questions, such as identifying the demographic groups most likely to develop specific medical conditions. These demographics include but are not limited to sex, age, and country of origin. While the dataset lacks a specific ethnicity variable, it can be adapted to compare different regions and create ethnic-like categories, enabling comparisons between Latin ethnic groups from Europe and South America, among other possibilities, without making broad assumptions or stereotyping. Dataset 2: Vital Statistics Natality Birth https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data https://data.nber.org/nvss/natality/csv/nat2021us.csv Data 2021 Data on birth rates and demographics is provided by the National Vital Statistics System of the National Center for Health Statistics. This data pertains to births that occurred in a specific calendar year and is derived from information extracted from birth certificates submitted to vital statistics offices in each state and the District of Columbia. The data files for the United States are structured as follows: Prior to 1972, data was based on a 50-percent sample of birth certificates from all states. However, starting in 1972, data transitioned to a 100-percent sample of birth certificates from certain states, while the remaining states continued to provide a 50-percent sample. Over time, the number of states contributing 100 percent of their records has grown, encompassing all states and the District of Columbia by 1985. This dataset comprises a total of 369,928 observations and encompasses 225 factors, which include variables such as the racial background of parents and the health condition of the newborn. Specifically,interested in examining the relationship between a mother’s education, race, and age in this dataset.\nDataset 3 : Proportion adults who are current smokers (2012-2018 California) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/proportion-of-adults-who-are-current-smokers-lghc-indicator-b50c4 This dataset was originally collected from Let’s Healthy California (https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/.), an organization dedicated to fostering a collaborative and systematic approach to assess and monitor the health status of Californians. The data within this dataset are amassed monthly, drawing from a random sample of Californians aged 18 and above. Our objective is to delve into the trends and prevalence of smoking among adults in California. Furthermore, we aim to find the interplay between various variables present in the dataset and understand how they influence smoking percentages. author: “” date: “2023-10-23” date-modified: “2023-10-23”"

It describes the type of employees that were hired for various development projects taking place in Boston. We can use this dataset to outline the relationships between the area of residence, ethnicity, sex, and job someone may have. The goal of this dataset was to offer insights into how project managers and individual development initiatives adhere to policy requirements, as determined by their workforce. By gathering and sharing data related to the Residents Jobs Policy, the City aims to diminish disparities related to race and gender in construction projects while simultaneously enhancing employment prospects for Boston residents.\nThis dataset is not one of our original 3 datasets that we included in blog post 1. We felt that our original 3 proposed datasets were not adequate enough to conduct our project in. The first dataset was from Kaggle and generated by chatGPT so any outcomes that we would have come to throughout our project would not be based on real data. The second dataset was not only massive, but also the variables were mainly describing the demographics of a mother, a father, and their child so there wasn’t much opportunity to make a significant predictive model. The third dataset was simply too small. We feel that this dataset is definitely big enough and gives us opportunities to predict various outcomes. For example, we could potentially predict the demographics of workers based on where the development project takes place.\nOriginal 14 variables: agency, compliance_project_name, project_address, neighborhood, developer, general_contractor_name, subcontractor, trade, period_ending, gender, person_of_color, race, boston_resident, worker_hours_this_period\nData Cleaning:\nCan eliminate the following variables: person_of_color, project_address, developer, general_contractor_name, subcontractor\nperson_of_color: this is a binary variable but can look at “race” to determine whether the person is of color or not, so this variable is not necessary. project_address: There is a “neighborhood” variable that is a little more general but still encapsulates the residence of the particular observation. A specific address may be too small and trivial to actually be predicted, or be used to predict.\nDataset 2 Birth data: https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data This dataset contains a total of 3,669,928 observations with 225 different factors.

The dataset spans multiple years, with data collection methods evolving over time.\nThe dataset is a valuable resource interested in understanding how maternal education, racial backgrounds, and maternal age impact various aspects of childbirth, healthcare, and demographic trends in the United States. It plays a critical role in addressing disparities and improving healthcare and support systems for expectant mothers and newborns\nData Cleaning:\nCan eliminate the following variables: Mother’s age,race, education, daily smoke before pregnancy, height in inches, bmi, weight in pound before pregnancy, weight in pound when delivered, pre-diabetes, Birth Weight"

    "section": "1. Linear Regression Analysis on maternal age at first child’s birth",
    "text": "1. Linear Regression Analysis on maternal age at first child’s birth\nIn the linear regression analysis conducted, the dependent variable was the maternal age at first child’s birth (mager), modeled as a function of various maternal characteristics and health-related behaviors. The independent variables in the model included maternal education (meduc), height (m_ht_in), Body Mass Index (BMI), pre-pregnancy weight (pwgt_r), weight at delivery (dwgt_r), marital status (Married), presence of gestational diabetes (GDiabetes), and smoking habits before and during pregnancy (cig_before and cig_during, respectively). Besides, we also joining another two dataset to help use consider the social determinants. First is a dataset about Real Per Capita Personal Income for the United States (RPIPCUS) from 2016 to 2021. Secondly\nWe used Social Determinants, Health Impact,Gestational Diabetes and Pregnancy Outcomes,Smoking Habits and Height as a Factor to predict the mother age and underage pregnancy. We constructed three linear regression models, each adding layers of complexity and depth to our analysis:\n\nModel 1: Utilizes demographic information.\nModel 2: Expands on Model 1 by including socio-economic background information.\nModel 3: Incorporates demographic, socio-economic, and birth-related variables.\n\nComparing multiple R-squared and adjusted R-squared values for the three models provides valuable insights into their goodness-of-fit and explanatory power. Although the differences between the models are subtle, they are important for understanding their relative validity. From the first model (0.4206) the second model (0.4207) and the third model (0.4207), both the multiple R-squared values and the adjusted R-squared values increased slightly, indicating a marginal improvement in explaining the variance of the dependent variable. This suggests that additional variables or improvements introduced in the subsequent models contributed slightly to the overall explanatory power. The adjusted R-squared values (which take into account the number of predictor variables and model complexity) follow a similar trend, showing slight improvements when we move from the first model (0.4206) the second model (0.4206) and the third model (0.4206). This emphasizes the importance of adjusting the model complexity and enhancing the value of the additional variables included. Indeed, the selected model should not only provide a higher R-squared, but should also be consistent with the theoretical framework and provide meaningful insights. Further review of the variables included, their importance, and the context of the study would help to fully understand the utility of the model.It is a given that more variables lead to higher r-square. For the p value of all three models was 2.2e-16 Less than 0.05 means that the three models were judged as “significant”.\nThe first model AIC scores were 685678.3. The second model AIC scores were 695675.6. The third model predicts motherage by AIC Scores were 695675.6.Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) also provided valuable insights into the relative goodness of fit and complexity of the models. The AIC scores (Model 2 had the lowest score of 695675.6) indicated that Model 2 was the most parsimonious and effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data among the models considered. The careful evaluation of each model’s AIC illuminates the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model complexity. While a lower AIC indicates a better model fit, this must be balanced against the interpretability and utility of the model in practical applications. In essence, this model comparison exercise not only helps to select the best model, but also emphasizes the importance of a holistic and context-aware approach to statistical modeling. The process from model selection to interpretation provides a continuous cycle of refinement that ensures a dynamic and robust analytical framework for addressing complex research questions.\n\n\nTo summarize we chose the second model. Since the Figure “Histogram of Mother’s Age” shows that our dependent variable is slightly right-skewed, in order to make the age dependent variable more normal, we log-transformed the dependent variable. And the Adjusted R- Squared went from 0.4206 to 0.4506 with a significant increase, while the AIC decreased significantly, from 695675.6 to -993302.25 with a significant decrease. Our logarithmic transformation gets better later, as it is a bit more normalized with respect to the age distribution we were trying to predict. However, the large drop that occurs is surprising and could mean that we are now using a better model, but the reason for such a significant drop is still puzzling and deserves to be investigated later.\n\nHere is the Figure “Linear Regression Coefficients by Predictor” for model 2 after Log transformation, we can have an overview for the important variables for linear regression. Cig-during,Cig-before,GDbiabetes, Married, meduc(Mother education), RaceAsian, all show positive correlation on underage pregnancy."

    "text": "2. Logistic Regression Analysis on maternal age at first child’s birth\nWe created a total of three logistic models to predict underage pregnancy.The first model predicted underage pregnancy by demographic. The second model predicted underage pregnancy by demographic and socio economic factors. The third model predicts underage pregnancy by demographic,social economic and birth correlate factor. When we evaluate logistic regression models, we typically look at a variety of metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), P-Value, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) Score.\n\nIn logistic regression, accuracy is the proportion of correctly categorized instances (true positives and true negatives) to the total instances. It measures the overall correctness of the model’s predictions. As we set 50% as our dividing line, the probability below would count as 0 to underage, and more would count as 1. It is virtually the same across all models, hovering around 87.44%, but model 1 does have the highest accuracy.\nMSE stands for Mean Square Error. It is a measure of the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values in a set of data points. In our model, the mse is based on the average absolute difference between predicted probability and actual outcome, which the range of the mse would be limited between 0 to 1. Overall, in our case, our mse got a low MSE overall. As a lower MSE indicates better predictive performance, our model 1 shows a best model as mse to be 0.08227\nThe Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. AUC represents the degree to which the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. All models have an AUC score above 0.87, indicating good predictive power, with Model 1 having a marginally higher AUC at 0.8836. Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate) and Specificity (true negative rate) are both measures of a test’s accuracy. Model 3 shows a slightly higher Specificity, indicating it is better at correctly identifying negative outcomes, which could be a deciding factor if the cost of false positives is high in the specific application context.\nThe AIC Score is used to compare models; the lower the AIC score, the better. Model 1 stands out with a notably lower AIC score (51733.60) than the other two models. This suggests that Model 1, while having a marginal increase in MSE, achieves a better balance between model complexity and goodness of fit to the data. Given the metrics provided, Model 1 might be considered the best model overall, as it maintains high accuracy and specificity, and offers the best AIC score, indicating a more parsimonious model. However, the final choice of the model should also consider the specific context of the analysis, the consequences of false positives and negatives, and whether a reduction in complexity is worth the trade-off for a slight decrease in certain performance metrics.\nAll three models had similar MSE, accuracy, and AUC values, indicating comparable predictive performance. Model 1, by these measures, could be regarded as the superior model, provided that the differences in model performance are meaningful within the specific practical context of their application.\n\nThe histogram bars are colored differently for each outcome category, with one color representing the non-underage cases (0) and another representing the underage cases (1). This plot is helpful for understanding how well the model can separate the two classes. Ideally, in a well-performing logistic regression model, we would expect to see most of the predicted probabilities for the actual underage cases (1) clustered towards the higher end of the probability scale (closer to 1), and the predicted probabilities for the non-underage cases (0) clustered towards the lower end (closer to 0). However, any substantial number of cases far from these peaks, especially if they overlap significantly, might indicate potential issues with model performance.\n Secondly, the probability of underage by education and Race shows all lines start close together at the lower left, indicating a high probability of underage pregnancy at lower education levels for all groups. As education levels increase, the probability of underage pregnancy decreases sharply for each group. This general trend is a common finding in demographic studies, which often show that higher education levels are associated with lower rates of teenage pregnancy.The lines begin to diverge as education increases, suggesting that the impact of education on the probability of underage pregnancy may vary by race and ethnicity. The shaded area around the lines suggests a confidence interval or standard error, showing the range within which the true line is likely to be. This interval seems to widen as education increases, indicating greater uncertainty in the model’s predictions at higher education levels, which could be due to fewer observations in the dataset at these levels."

    "text": "Limitations and Area for Improvements\n\nFirst limitation in our work is the high correlation between age and education in our data, and we struggle to mitigate the risk of collinearity caused by these two variables. In the future, we might explore using PCA or other techniques to address this issue and generate deeper insights among the variables.\nSecondly, our logistic model initially suffers from imbalance, with only a small portion of the dataset representing underage pregnancy. This presents a risk of bias in an imbalanced dataset. To counteract this bias, we implemented blocking on the underage pregnancy variable, selecting 10,000 cases of underage pregnancy and 10,000 cases of non-underage pregnancy. However, this blocking significantly reduces the effect of the year on the logistic model. In the future, we might develop more balanced models or improve our blocking methods.\nAdditionally, incorporating data on factors not included in our study, such as cultural influences or access to healthcare, could further refine our understanding."

    "text": "How Education Levels are Redefining Motherhood Across Race\n\nProblem We Aim to Solve\nUnderage pregnancies, this simple yet loaded question outlines a phenomenon that plagues families and societies all around the world. Younger mothers are at higher risk for pregnancy-related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby may include premature birth and a low birth weight. Additionally, underage pregnancies can easily compromise a struggling family’s finances with the additional burden of a child they were not prepared for. According to data from the National Library of Medicine, Underage pregnancies have decreased globally, from 64.5 per 1000 women in 2000 to 42.5 per 1000 women in 2021. However, there are huge differences in levels between and within countries and race.\n\n\nPattern Behind the Data\nIn order to investigate the causes of underage pregnancies, our team conducted various statistical analyses using data from the National Bureau of Economic Research, specifically Natality Birth Data. We select random samples from 2016 to 2021 and combine them together for a comprehensive analysis, focusing on motherhood across different races and examining how education influences the age at which women begin motherhood. With running linear and logistic regression analyses, Underage pregnancy shows intricately linked to a spectrum of socio-economic, educational, and health-related factors, and these relationships have evolved distinctly.\n\nThe figure “First Kid Birth Age vs Year” shows first kid birth age change over time. It shows the average age at which women from different racial backgrounds are having their first child from the year 2016 to 2021. The trend lines indicate that for some race groups, like Asian and White, the age of first-time motherhood is gradually increasing. For other groups, the lines are relatively flat, suggesting that the age of first birth remains constant. Overall, from 2016 to 2021, there is a steady or increasing age of first birth which may indicate a need for increased reproductive health education during later stages of life. Furthermore, we incorporate the dataset about Real Per Capita Personal Income for the United States (RPIPCUS) from 2016 to 2021. In the “First Kid Birth Age vs real per Capita”, as real per capita income increases, so does the age at which women have their first child, especially among Asian and White populations, suggests that economic stability may play a role in family planning decisions.\n\nIn the “First Kid Birth Age vs Prepreg Education Level Graph”, the relationship between a woman’s education level (measured from less than high school to doctorate degrees) and the age at which she has her first child is overall positive. Higher education levels generally correlate with older ages at first birth, a trend consistent across all racial groups. However, the slopes and positions of the lines vary, suggesting that the influence of education on family planning decisions is experienced differently across racial communities. A notable observation is a peak around education level 6, which corresponds to a Bachelor’s degree (BA, AB, BS). With the exception of Asians, most racial groups show a decline in first birth rates after reaching education level 6. Furthermore, the dataset records the age at first birth, which can lead to a confounding situation. This is because individuals who give birth at a younger age may have a lower likelihood of continuing their education. We will provide further explanation about our model in the Analysis section."

After processing the individual yearly datasets, We combines them into one large dataset (birthdata). Finally, the combined database to Birth related statistical data and US yearly income-social economics.We also use Real Per Capita Personal Income for the United States (RPIPCUS) from Federal Reserve Economic Data.We find Birth related statistic data by web crawler the NVSS website to get yearly Birth related statistic numbers from 2016-2022. The use of additional R packages such as “pROC” and “broom” can greatly enhance the analysis and interpretation of logistic regression models, providing more depth and clarity in the results.\nThe “pROC” package is a powerful tool in the R ecosystem designed specifically for analyzing and visualizing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curves are essential for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of probability predictions in binary classification models. They plot the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold settings, helping to determine the threshold that best separates the two classes. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a single scalar value derived from the ROC curve that summarizes the model’s ability to discriminate between the positive and negative classes. An AUC value close to 1 indicates a model with excellent predictive accuracy, while an AUC close to 0.5 suggests no discriminatory power. The “pROC” package simplifies these tasks by providing functions to compute ROC curves, AUC scores, and to compare different ROC curves, thus providing a nuanced evaluation of model performance.\nThe “broom” package in R is designed to work in tandem with modeling functions like lm() and glm(). It takes the output of these models and converts them into tidy data frames. This is particularly useful because the standard output from modeling functions in R does not lend itself easily to downstream data manipulation and visualization tasks. By using “broom,” analysts can quickly extract model coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and other important metrics from their models and use them in conjunction with packages like “ggplot2” for advanced visualizations. For instance, the tidied output from “broom” can be used to create coefficient plots which provide a visual interpretation of the influence each predictor has on the response variable, thus making the interpretation of model outputs more intuitive and insightful.\nThe caret package effectively abstracts much of the complexity involved in the model-building process, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on interpreting results and making decisions based on the model’s predictions. It’s a valuable addition to the data analysis workflow, particularly for those aiming to produce robust, reproducible predictive models.\nlibrary(dplyr) birthdata &lt;-read.csv(“dataset/cleanedbirth.csv”) BirthStat &lt;- read.csv(“dataset/BirthStat.csv”) YI &lt;- read.csv(“dataset/Yearly income data.csv”) combirth &lt;- birthdata |&gt; left_join(YI, by = c(“Year” = “Year”)) allbirth &lt;- combirth |&gt; left_join(BirthStat, by = c(“Year” = “Year”))\nIn the data consolidation process for our analysis, we orchestrated the integration of multiple datasets to construct a singular, enriched dataset using R’s dplyr package. The foundational dataset birthdata, which contains cleaned birth records, was merged with yearly income data (YI) based on the common ‘Year’ variable, ensuring a chronological alignment of data points. This initial merge formed combirth, a dataset that now encapsulates both birth records and associated income data for corresponding years.\nSubsequently, we augmented combirth with the BirthStat dataset, which includes various birth statistics obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The left_join function was employed once again on the ‘Year’ variable, creating allbirth, a comprehensive dataset that not only details birth records with socio-economic context provided by income data but also integrates broader birth statistics, enhancing the dataset’s depth and potential for nuanced analysis. This meticulous merging process was imperative for subsequent analysis, as it consolidated relevant variables into a single frame of reference for robust statistical examination."
